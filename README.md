# APACC Validation & Simulation Toolkit

## 🚘 Companion to PhD Thesis and International Patent Family

This repository provides the official implementation and simulation suite for **APACC** — *Artificial Precognition Adaptive Cognised Control* — a patented neuro-symbolic architecture for anticipatory, certifiable autonomous control.  
APACC combines symbolic Type-2 fuzzy reasoning with GPU-accelerated predictive optimisation to achieve sub-10ms control performance with full rule traceability, enabling compliance with ISO 26262 and SOTIF standards.

Validated across **24,500 multi-scenario simulations**, this release supports reproducible experimentation, edge deployment, and formal certification pathways.
