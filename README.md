﻿# APACC Validation & Simulation Toolkit

## 🚘 Companion to PhD Thesis and International Patent Family

This repository provides the full implementation and simulation suite for **APACC** — *Artificial Precognition Adaptive Cognised Control* — a dual-layer symbolic–numeric control architecture protected under [US9645576B2](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9645576B2).  

APACC enables anticipatory, explainable, and certifiable autonomous control. Validated across **24,500 multi-scenario simulations**, it combines symbolic reasoning with GPU-accelerated predictive optimisation to deliver sub-10ms real-time performance with full rule traceability.
